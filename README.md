# PhysicallyBasedRenderer
A phyiscally based renderer, the GLSL shaders used physically plausible calculations to calculate the diffusion and specularity across the objects. It uses a deferred rendering technique, requiring two passes, so as to only perform lighting calculations on the the objects seen by the camera.

The code has not been written to be used by anyone else and hence the libraries are held in main the file.
This was a personal project undertaken to understand and program in C++ for the GPU therefore no dependencies will be given as it is not designed to be exist outside of that scope.
